"""
This program demonstreates using the NMDP SQLite3 database.

The program takes one command-line argument, which is the path to a NMDP
SQLite3 database file.  If the database does not exist, it is created.

The program downloads the latest NMDP zip file (from the path in `NMDP_URL`).
It looks inside the zip file for the MAC file (looking for the file name in
`NMDP_FILENAME`).  A temporary file is used to store the zip file, which should
be cleaned up automatically when the program finishes running.
